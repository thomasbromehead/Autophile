				<h2>Don't have the know-how?</h2>
				<p>Classic cars are great but they need <span class="attention">constant attention.</span>

					<li>
					Need an electronic ignition on your Jag?
					</li>
					<li>Want to get that overdrive working?</li>
					<li>Need help synchronizing your Webers?</li>

				<h2>Don't have the tools?</h2>
				<p>Classic cars need special tooling, it's a fact</p>
				<p>You'll likely struggle <span class="attention">a lot</span> if you don't have them...</p>
				<p><span class="attention">Tools are costly and require know-how.</span> <br/>We don't think the average classic car owner wants to spend hours and hundreds of $ on purchasing that compression meter or that caliper wind back tool.</p>

				<h2>Lost trust in local garages?</h2>
				<p>We know how it feels... Low-ball offers to entice you and work takes forever to commence... </p> <p><span class="attention">Long delays, poor communication are common in the classic car industry.</span></p>
				<p>Your passion will be tested time and again if it hasn't already. <br/> We think you deserve to be treated better.</p>

				<h2>Your best mechanic could be your neighbor!</h2>
				<p>As collectors ourselves we know what to look for in a mechanic and think there are many skilled enthusiasts who would love to work on your car.</p>
				<p>We ask lots of questions before allowing someone on the platform and make sure he knows what he's doing and has a classic car or bike himself.</p>
